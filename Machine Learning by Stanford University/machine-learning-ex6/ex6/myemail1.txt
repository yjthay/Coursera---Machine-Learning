A BIG Thank You, YJ!
 
To you and all iSKI users.

 

More and more users share their joy of skiing within the global iSKI Community. Monthly, millions of iSKI users are informed about the current situation in ski areas and are tracking their ski days. In the past season thousands of iSKI Trophy PINS were collected by Users from Canada to Japan. Among the lucky PIN collectors many HEAD skis and other great prizes were raffled again. For all those who haven't had enough of sliding on the white stuff, there is still Glacier skiing!

 

We wish you a lot of skiing pleasure and looking forward to your feedback.
